## **Installing Visual Studio Code**

> Visit the VSCode website to download the software: [click here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
<br>

Depending on what computer you have, download the corresponding file

<br> 

>Once your file has downloaded, click on it to open, and follow the instructions prompted on your computer to finish setting up

After you finishing downloading and you open VSCode, you will see this welcome screen

## **Remotely Connecting**

>**NOTE: Before I started:** since I'm on **Windows**, I needed to install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

<br>

>1. Find your course-specific account for CSE15L here: [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
>2. Open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl or Command + `, or use the Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option)
>3. Type in this command: ```ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` but replace ```zz``` with the three letter of your own course-specific account
>4. Follow the prompt
>>**NOTE:** if your password does not work, make sure to reset it [here](https://password.ucsd.edu/)

<br>

Once I logged in, my terminal output looked like this:
```
Hello cs15lwi22ane, you are currently logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu

You are using 0% CPU on this system

Yay! Now onto the next part!

## **Running Some Commands**

<br>

Here's a list of cool commands I tried + the outputs and explanations

| Command | Description | Output |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| cd      | changes directory (only if you specify a directory name) | ```blank```|
| ls      | lists files in the directory | ```Main.class  Main.java  WhereAmI.class  perl5``` |
| pwd     | prints the full name of the current directory | ```/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi22/cs15lwi22ane``` |
| mkdir report1 | creates a new directory with the name ```report1``` | ```blank``` |

<br>

Check out this command ```ls -a```:

>Woah! Why are there so many items??

>>```ls``` lists directory contents and ```-a``` stands for all, so this command lists all the contents within the directory I'm in

<br>

Lastly, a cool and useful trick: press Ctrl/Cmd-D and type ```exit```
>Ctrl/Cmd-D logs you out of your school-specific account and ```exit``` closes the terminal

## **Moving Files over SSH with scp**

<br>

>First, I need a file:

* Create a file in VSCode called ```whereAmI.java```
```
class WhereAmI{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("hello world!");
        }
}
```

>Open up the terminal in VSCode and run this command: ```scp whereAmI.java cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/``` (remember to replace the ```zz```)

>Next, login with ssh. Once successful, you can use ```ls``` to see if your new file is there!

<br> 

Here's my full process:

## **Setting an SSH Key**

<br>

>Follow the steps here to create an SSH key: [click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation)

<br> Once it's a success, I am be able to login without having to type my password!

## **Optimizing Remote Running**

<br>

> These are the two things I considered: **time** and **code-length**

* With the key that we created in the previous section, it saves you a lot of time

* Moreover, we can even shorten the number of times we have to ```enter``` in the command prompt too:
